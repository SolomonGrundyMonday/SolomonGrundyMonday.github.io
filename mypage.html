        <h1>Colgan, Jeff</h1>
        <p>I am studying Computer Science because I want to design video games, and because I enjoy solving complicated problems.  Some interesting things about me are: I play piano, I was in the high school jazz band, and I lived in Europe for a summer during High School.</p>
